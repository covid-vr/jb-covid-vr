    "\n",
    "To perform binary classification with our private dataset provided from HCPA and HMV, distinguishing patients classified as having typical COVID-19 lung infection by a radiologist from one of the two hospitals. This binary classification was conceived agglutinating three of the original possible radiological diagnosis given to patients following the RSNA standard; those three classes are negative, atypical, and indeterminate. {numref}`Figure {number} <binary-matrix>` presents our best result for ternary classification using ResNet101 as backbone and Transfer Function 6. For all the binary classification tasks we use COVID-19 label as positive class to obtain all presented metrics. It should be noted that we could not use TheSaviours approach for the lack os annotations at slice-level for our private dataset.\n",

    "As mentioned COVID-19 is our positive class, while for this experiment for negative class we merged the Negative, Indeterminate, and Atypical classes (from RSNA classification) into a unique **non-COVID-19 class (Others)**. Performance assessment was based on 5-fold CV, using the same folds configuration for COVID-VR, DeCoVNet, and COVNet.
