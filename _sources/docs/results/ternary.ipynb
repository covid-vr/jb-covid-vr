    "\n",
    "To this task we use the public dataset from SPGC to perform ternary classification using the dataset’s original classes (COVID-19, Normal and CAP) which provided a more direct comparison with other published works that reported their results training and validating with data from the competition. While working with the SPGC dataset, we defined training and validation sets according to the data split published by the ICCASP-SPGC competition. {numref}`Figure {number} <ternary-matrix>` presents our best result for ternary classification using ResNet101 as backbone and Transfer Function 6.\n",
